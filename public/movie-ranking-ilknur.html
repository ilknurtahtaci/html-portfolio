<h1>The Best Movies According to Ä°lknur</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr /> 

<h3>Prestige</h3>
<p>
    This movie fascinated me with its constant curiosity while watching and the details hidden in its scenes. With my surprise at the end of the movie, I wanted to watch it constantly.

<h3>Forrest Gump</h3>
<p>
    Forrest Gump was a movie that made you smile while watching it and made you believe that good things can still happen. I think everyone should watch it.
</p>

<h3>Titanic</h3>
<p>
    Although Titanic is considered a classic movie, in my opinion it is a unique movie in terms of the emotions it makes you feel while watching it. The hopes and luxury carried by this large ship heading to the American continent reveal the class difference between people. At the same time, while telling about the oppression of women and their place in society, the fearless and freedom-filled love experienced by Jake and Rose deeply affected me.
